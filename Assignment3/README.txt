This readme if for assignment3 of CS275.
This web page is programmed to take valid user input and display the factorial or summation, whatever user selects. To run the program, first, download the zip file and unzip it. Then run the node server on your computer. You can run the server on your terminal/cmd. To run the server in the terminal, first go to the directory where the assignment folder is, and then type "node myserver.js" without the quotes.
If the server runs, there should be a line printed saying "Server running...". Once the server runs, open up the web browser (google chrome preferred) and type "http://localhost:8080/ss4674_HW3.html" without the quotes. The ss4674_HW3.html page should be loaded. 
Then type in the valid input in the input box and select the option from the drop-down to use either factorial or summation. Then click the button. If everything goes well then you should see the desired result beneath the button.

*Note: I have not included the dataType in the ajax function as it was not working for me. I posted about this issue on Piazza and confirmed with Professor Borlick to submit without mentioning the dataType. However, if this web app does not run properly on your machine, please try putting the dataType as Text or html or JSON. 

Thank You
