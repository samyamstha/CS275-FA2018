The technologies used are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and Node.js.In order to use the app, first download the zipped folder and unzip its contents. Then in the terminal go to the directory of where the project is located and run the node server. The name of my server is MainServer.js. So, in order to run the server, you would type “node MainServer.js” in your terminal. After the server is successfully running, you should be able to see a message that says the server is up and running. Then go to your browser (Google chrome preferred) and to http://localhost:8080/. The server is set to use the port 8080 here. After the app loads on this link, you should be able to see the home page on your browser that explains how to use the app.
