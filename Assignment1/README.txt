The web page takes a valid number as input and then displays the Fibonacci sequence starting form 0 till the index of the provided input. 
To run the webpage just download the assignment folder and then open the html file named “ss4674_HW1.html”. The webpage should open up in your default web browser and display its contents. Now you can enter a valid input into the text box and click on the compute button to generate the output. The output is a table consisting of Fibonacci numbers starting from index 0 to the provided number.
The JavaScript code computes the Fibonacci sequence and also checks for the validity of inputs.
